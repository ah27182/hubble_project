### A quick little personal note
I think studying the sky is one of the most fascinating things a person can do. So many city dwellers, including myself, forget that we live under a sky filled to the brim with wonder. Its hard to put into words, but looking at a clear night sky truly unleashes the reality that we are exisiting in.
